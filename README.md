# java-data-structures-algorithms
Welcome to the Java Data Structures &amp; Algorithms repository! ðŸš€  This project is designed to help you learn and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java. It serves as a learning resource, an interview preparation guide, and a reference for competitive programming.
<br><br>
Here, you will find:<br>
âœ… Efficient Implementations â€“ Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more. <br>
âœ… Algorithmic Solutions â€“ Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, and Backtracking.<br>
âœ… Code Optimization â€“ Time complexity analysis and best coding practices.<br>
âœ… Unit Tests (JUnit) â€“ Well-structured test cases for reliability.<br>
<br><br>
Stay tuned for updates ðŸš€
