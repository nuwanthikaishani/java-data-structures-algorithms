# java-data-structures-algorithms
Welcome to the Java Data Structures &amp; Algorithms repository! ðŸš€  This project is designed to help you learn and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java. It serves as a learning resource, an interview preparation guide, and a reference for competitive programming.

Here, you will find:
âœ… Efficient Implementations â€“ Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more.
âœ… Algorithmic Solutions â€“ Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, and Backtracking.
âœ… Code Optimization â€“ Time complexity analysis and best coding practices.
âœ… Unit Tests (JUnit) â€“ Well-structured test cases for reliability.

Stay tuned for updates ðŸš€
